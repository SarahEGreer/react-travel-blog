# Travel Blog Built with React
### Live site: 

## Overview
This Travel Blog was a solo project from [The Scrimba Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com). I was provided a Figma File, which featured a desktop version of the site. I chose to make the site responsive and include a mobile version. 

The purpose of building this static site in React was to practice React syntax and creating React components, as well as React Props. 

My focus during the building process was creating a visually appealing and responsive, as well writing clean readable code.
